fix curly brace mathcing (or ditch)
work on allowing file tree to repaint after run and show a different directory
got rid of the auto compile feature
bold and italics may or may not work at the moment
coming soon: documents view, where you can see the currently open documents in a different view
coming soon: syntax highlighting: certain chars (and possibly later, certain words) will be highlighted different colors

doucments view:
add jtabbedpane above the file tree so that the user can switch in between the file tree and the documents view
documents view will represent each open tab as some kind of graphic visual and when clicked will switch the open tab in the editor
make the docs view scroll
add a right click menu so that allows view and close actions on each menu item

syntax higlighting
see the chrome bookmark of stack over flow post for more information
will need to init the jeditorpane witha styled document
add a style to the document, then set character attributes for that style
will highlight {, [, in one color, then numbers in another color
later add in highlighting for words like "new", "system" etc.

right click menu
need a way to have the right click menu show up on right click no matter the tab that it is currently in
possibly add it to the main interface or some other upper level container then query the jtabbedpane as to which editor is currently active
